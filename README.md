Google Photo API App

## Getting Started

To all potential users,

I am Bao, the developer behind this application. Before downloading the app, please take note of the following points:

1. You will need to use your Google account to log into the app.
2. The application may access your photos in Google Photos.
3. You cannot delete photos from within the app, as the Google Photos API does not support this functionality in its current programming.
4. You can only add photos to an album that have been uploaded through the app. It is not possible to add other photos because they either do not exist or have incorrect Media Item IDs.
5. You cannot delete albums.
I hope you have a great experience with the app. As this application was built for experimental purposes, there may be some errors. Thank you for your understanding.
